    <h1>Coffee Tastings</h1>
    <p>
        I enjoy trying out <strong>specialty cafes</strong> wherever I am. Each cafe usually specializes in a certain type of coffee or drink. Being able to see how one cafe's
        drink compares to another and watching how their technique translates to noteable differences in flavor always amazes me. Many specialty cafes also use <strong>single origin</strong>
        coffee beans which each have unique flavor profiles and do <strong>in house</strong> roasting of those beans, adding another layer of complexity and uniqueness to each cafe. one
        of my favorite cafes in the Sacramento area would be <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/scorpiocoffee">Scorpio Coffee</a>. Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso_and_tonic">espresso tonic</a>
        is perfect for a refreshing summer drink!
